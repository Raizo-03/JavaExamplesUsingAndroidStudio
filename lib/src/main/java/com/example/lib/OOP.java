    //Methods
    //method that is a block of code that performs a specific task

    //Types of Methods
    //User defined & standard library methods

    //Declaring java method
    // returnType = value that method returns
    // void return type = returns nothing

    // identifier = method name


    //Parameters/ ARGUMENTS = constraints of the method
    //public static void Name(String name) = accepts/requires string value

    //Method overloading = using the same method but different parameters
    // or arguments


    //CLASSES
    //object = instance of a class
    // has entity or behavior

    //class = template or blueprint

    // fields/ variables - stores data
    //methods = behavior


    //Constructors
    //Expected arguments

    //Access Modifiers
    //public = avail to all diff packages and class
    //private = only same class
    //protected = classes within the same package and subclasses
    //default = only the same package


    //OOP
    //Encapsulation = getters and setters
    //Inheritance = subclass from a parent class using extend keyword
    //Polymorphism = allows objects to be treated as instance of their parent class
    //Two type of polymorphism = method overloading(compile time polymo) = the same name, modifier, but different return types/ arguments
    //method overriding(runtime poly) = when a method from parent class is overriden in the child class
    //Abstraction = used to simplify complex systems by hiding unnecessary details and exposing only the essential features.
    //Interface (type of abstraction) = making a final or a set of abstract attributes/methods in a class/ general rules
    //Can create multiple interface but cannot create multiple inheritance
